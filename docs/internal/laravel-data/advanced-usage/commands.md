## # # make:data

You can easily generate new data objects with the artisan command make:data:

```
php artisan make:data PostData
```

By default, this command puts data objects in the App\Data namespace, this can be changed as such:

```
php artisan make:data PostData --namespace=DataTransferObjects
```

By default, the command creates a new data object within the \App\Data namespace and suffixes the class with Data, this can be changed by adding the following lines to the data.php config file:

```
'commands'=> [/*
     * Provides default configuration for the `make:data` command. These settings can be overridden with options
     * passed directly to the `make:data` command for generating single Data classes, or if not set they will
     * automatically fall back to these defaults. See `php artisan make:data --help` for more information
     */'make'=> [/*
         * The default namespace for generated Data classes. This exists under the application's root namespace,
         * so the default 'Data` will end up as '\App\Data', and generated Data classes will be placed in the
         * app/Data/ folder. Data classes can live anywhere, but this is where `make:data` will put them.
         */'namespace'=>'Data',/*
         * This suffix will be appended to all data classes generated by make:data, so that they are less likely
         * to conflict with other related classes, controllers or models with a similar name without resorting
         * to adding an alias for the Data object. Set to a blank string (not null) to disable.
         */'suffix'=>'Data',
    ],
]
```
