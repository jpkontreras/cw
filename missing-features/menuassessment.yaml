 Professional Assessment

  Looking at the current implementation, I'll provide an honest analysis of missing features:

  Missing UI Features That Would Impact Users

  From the interface shown:

  1. Pricing Display - CRITICAL: Items show "No price" despite backend support for prices and
  overrides. This is fundamental for menu management.
  2. Modifiers/Options - HIGH IMPACT: No way to configure item modifiers (size options, add-ons,
  customizations). The backend has MenuItemModifier model ready but completely unused.
  3. Availability Management - HIGH IMPACT: No visual indicators for active/inactive items or
  time-based availability rules. Backend has MenuAvailabilityRule with sophisticated
  day/time/date/capacity rules.
  4. Quick Item Preview - No hover preview or quick view of full item details (nutritional info,
  allergens, prep time).
  5. Bulk Operations - "Select All" exists but no actual bulk actions (bulk pricing, bulk
  enable/disable, bulk categorization).
  6. Advanced Search/Filters - Only basic category filter. Missing: price range, dietary filters,
  availability status, featured items.

  Backend Features Not Exposed in Builder

  From analyzing the server models at /app-modules/menu/src/Models/:

  1. MenuItemModifier System (models/MenuItemModifier.php:11-22)
    - Required/optional modifiers
    - Min/max selections
    - Price overrides per modifier
    - Default selections
  2. MenuAvailabilityRule (models/MenuAvailabilityRule.php:46-56)
    - Time-based rules (breakfast/lunch/dinner menus)
    - Day-based rules (weekend specials)
    - Date ranges (seasonal menus)
    - Capacity-based rules
  3. Nutritional & Dietary Information (models/MenuItem.php:26-29)
    - Dietary labels (vegan, gluten-free, etc.)
    - Allergen information
    - Calorie count
    - Full nutritional data
  4. Advanced Item Properties (models/MenuItem.php:19-25)
    - Preparation time overrides
    - Seasonal flags
    - Recommended items
    - Custom metadata
  5. Menu Versioning (models/MenuVersion.php)
    - Version history
    - Rollback capability
    - Change tracking

  Most Critical Gaps

  1. Modifiers - Restaurants need this for customization options
  2. Pricing - Can't operate without visible pricing
  3. Availability Rules - Essential for time-based menus (breakfast/lunch/dinner)
  4. Dietary/Allergen Info - Legal requirement in many jurisdictions

  The backend architecture is well-designed with comprehensive features, but the frontend builder
  only exposes about 30% of the capabilities. The modular structure is solid, but the UI needs
  significant feature expansion to match the backend's sophistication.
